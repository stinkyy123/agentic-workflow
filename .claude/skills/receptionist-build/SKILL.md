  The method + landmines for building and deploying a MakeMyWorkflow AI receptionist from the
  receptionist-template. Use when generating a client config, rendering, deploying, or QA-ing a
  receptionist build. Distills the template's BUILD-NOTES.md: deploy ordering, the publish+re-pin
  dance, prompt/worker sync, the voice-config overwrite warning, Smarty policy, and the QA loop.

# Receptionist Build (method)

Source of truth for the code and every incident: `BUILD-NOTES.md` in the `receptionist-template`
repo — read it before touching the worker. **Parameterize, never refactor:** the worker's logic is
battle-tested; a needed logic change stops and asks Albert.

## Golden rule: deploy the worker FIRST, then Retell
A prompt expecting new worker behavior against an un-deployed worker is a silent mismatch.
Worker-only changes need just `wrangler deploy`; prompt/tool changes need the full Retell dance.

## The deploy dance (BUILD-NOTES §2 — skip a step and you ship into the void)
1. `cd clients/<client>/dist/worker && npx wrangler deploy` — needs `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, a
   **`cfut_` Workers token** (a `cfat_` token fails with 9109).
2. `RETELL_API_KEY=… TOOL_SECRET=… node deploy_retell.js <client>` — pushes prompt + tools to the LLM.
3. **Publish:** `POST https://api.retellai.com/publish-agent/<agent_id>` with body `{}`.
4. **RE-PIN the phone number** to the just-published version — THE #1 footgun:
   - The number hard-pins an integer `agent_version` in `inbound_agents`; it does NOT follow
     "latest published". Publishing changes nothing for callers until you re-pin.
   - Find the version: `GET /get-agent/<agent_id>` returns the current DRAFT number; the version you
     just published = **draft − 1**. Verify `is_published:true` at `GET /get-agent/<id>?version=N`.
   - `PATCH /update-phone-number/<E164>` with
     `{ "inbound_agents":[{ "agent_id":"…","agent_version":<INT>,"weight":1 }] }`.
     `agent_version` must be an integer; the old `inbound_agent_id/version` fields are deprecated (400).

## Voice config (BUILD-NOTES §3) — the overwrite warning
`deploy_retell.js` OVERWRITES every run: the LLM `general_prompt`+`general_tools`, and agent
`interruption_sensitivity`(0.3), `responsiveness`(1), `enable_backchannel`(false), `ambient_sound`.
It does NOT touch `voice_id/voice_model/voice_speed/voice_temperature/volume/stt_mode/
denoising_mode/backchannel_frequency/language/model` (dashboard-only). **Hand-tuning a
script-controlled field in the dashboard is silently reverted on the next deploy** — codify winners
into the script. `interruption_sensitivity 0.3` is the echo↔talk-over dial; drop to 0.2 if a tester
still hears the greeting stutter.

## Smarty address policy (BUILD-NOTES §4)
At `dpv==="Y"` Smarty is authoritative — trust its standardization, no flag. Deliverable-but-
non-exact → SOFT `address_autocorrected` (confirm SMS). `no_match`/undeliverable → HARD callback.
Ask-address-twice is the capture protocol; the WORKER compares the two captures, not the model.

## QA loop (maps the playbook's 10 pre-go-live scenarios to `loop-design`)
- **Checkable goal:** all 10 scenarios pass. **Hard cap:** stop after N build↔QA rounds; log each.
- **Automated (tool-call) scenarios** → `curl` payloads to `https://<baseUrl>/t/<TOOL_SECRET>`
  simulating each tool call; assert the worker's response + the resulting Bookings row/flag.
  ⚠️ test tool-calls write REAL Bookings rows (BUILD-NOTES §3 caveat) — use throwaway rows / the
  TEST agent clone; delete them after.
- **Voice scenarios** (echo, interrupts, heavy accent, angry caller) → flag for Albert's manual
  test calls; they cannot be automated.
- The 10: emergency (burst pipe 2am) · routine scheduling · pricing shopper · angry customer ·
  spam/wrong number · repeat customer · out-of-service-area · heavy accent/noise · caller interrupts
  mid-sentence · calendar conflict. Never let a call fail silently — the error workflow must alert.
